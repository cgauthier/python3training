# Training on Python 3.8

I've decided to undertake this little project in training myself on using Python.

I'm currently working with version 3.82

I'm using a Windows Pro 10 box with Visual Studio Code which works really well with Python with code completion, etc.

## My Training Goals 

- Learn the syntax
- Learn to create compiled modules for import
- Learn to implement various types of algorithms
- Learn how to use it with Django and Flask
    - REST APIS
    - Connect to both MongoDB and MySQL/MariaDB
- Learn to create a self-executing Python app

Because I have extensive experience in other general programming and scripting languages, I find it rather easy to use Python.

Even though I'm going through the python docs tutorial, I'm also including in the examples, either support utilities I'm writing, importing my own code, etc.

I've only spent a few hours so far and I suspect that in less than 40 hrs, I will accomplish much without any fuss.

The internet is full of resources and code samples.

Because I understand the concepts and the functionality most languages provides, I've found it very easy to figure out and adapt anything I've seen into useful code.

The repo will keep getting updated until I've reach my goals.

I will be editing this file anytime I figure out different aspect of Python I wish to learn and master.

Eventually, I will be making a few sample apps that will utilize Python for web services.

Python isn't hard to learn, it's very similar in concept to both Node and Java. 

It's weakly typed language (nowadays called dynamically typed)

And so far, I will admit, it's rather fun! :)
